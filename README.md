# coingecko api + React Native app

Using [coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en) as an api with [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/).

I have done this application for a personal project and wanted to try an improve my development skills when it comes to react ecosystem and to be more familiar and comfortable witha tech that I am already familiar with.
This app is made to be simple and may help people knowing React & Redux to get into creating mobile apps.

It's made with [coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en) as an api with [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/), coupled with Redux [Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/), [Navigation5(https://reactnavigation.org/)], dataflow and UI elements.
